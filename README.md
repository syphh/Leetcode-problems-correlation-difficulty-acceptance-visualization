# Leetcode-problems-correlation-difficulty-acceptance-visualization

Each LeetCode coding problem has an assigned difficulty (easy, medium, or hard), and an acceptance rate (percentage of accepted submissions). So I wanted to visualize the correlation between difficulty and acceptance (see plot below).

The result is that difficulty has an impact on acceptance, but that is not as strong as what we would think, there are easy problems with low acceptance rate and vice versa, hard problems with high acceptance rate.

We deduce that LeetCode should maybe have a closer look to some problems (outliers) to see if they are mislabeled. As a matter of fact, some users on the platform are complaining that some problems are not assigned the difficulty they truly deserve, which may negatively affect the user experience (e.g.: A beginner can lose confidence after failing to solve an "easy" problem that is in reality medium or hard).
